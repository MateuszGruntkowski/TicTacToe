This Java program implements the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. In Tic-Tac-Toe, two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to complete a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol (either "X" or "O").

Features
1. Game Board: The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid where players can place their marks.
2. Player vs. CPU: The game allows the player to play against the CPU (computer opponent).
3. Winning Conditions: The game checks for winning conditions after each move to determine if a player has won, lost, or if the game ended in a draw.
4. Input Validation: The program validates user input to ensure moves are made within the valid range and on an empty cell.
